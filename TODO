Some features missing from the script

* Start of Annuity can be deferred by a certain number of years
* Withdrawal of 60% corpus can be deferred by a certain number of years
* Partial withdrawals can be made after a certain period.

These features are not implemented in the script. They become relevant only when the NPS returns are higher than the returns if the money is invested oneself + return on annuity.
